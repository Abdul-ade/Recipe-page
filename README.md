- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

These are some of the major things I learned while working on this project.

```html
<menu class="preparation-section">
  <p class="subheading">Preparation time</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Total:</strong> Approximately 10 minutes</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Preparation:</strong> 5 minutes</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Cooking:</strong> 5 minutes</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</menu>
```

```css
li::marker {
  color: inherit;
  font-size: 1.3rem;
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to show a lot more dedication to building projects, knowing or mastering the skills can't be enough to work with. I plan on doing more frontend projects, show more dedication and of course get more mastery in my frontend skills.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18548465/prevent-scrollbar-from-adding-up-to-the-width-of-page-on-chrome) - This helped me with solutions for being able to style the markers for the list-style individually. I really liked this property and will use it going forward.
